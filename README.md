# Semester 4

This repository contains the assignments, lecture notes and handouts for the course CS202: Mathematics For Computer Science - I, taken by Prof. Manindra Agarwal, during 2023 - I (Fall) Semester.





## Course Description

The aim of this course is to learn discrete mathematics. It is the study of mathematical structures which are discrete (elements take finite values as opposed to continuous structures). It is very difficult to find a branch in computer science & engineering which does not use discrete mathematics. [Course FCH]


## Topics Covered

- Sets, Orders, and Proofs, [Sets, relations, functions, partial orders, equivalence classes, proof techniques]

- Counting, [Permutations, combinations, binomial coecients, partitions, generating functions, inclusion-exclusion, Ramsey theory]
 
- Graph Theory [Degree, paths, cycles, trees, planar graphs]

- Algebra [Groups, rings, fields, finite fields]
